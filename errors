compile  time o 
before out program runs
example 
   syntax related bugs
   missing files
  error linking object file
can be caught with static_assert( c++ 11 )
compilers can warn sometimes about bugs
other static analysis  tool can conservatively try to anticipate and report errors

run time
  while our program runs

examples 
   memory leaks
   seg faults
   performance related bugs
can be caught and handle with exceptions
can be caught with assert


memory leak 
if we allocate a bunch of memory in a loop and keep allocating it, we might eventually
run out of memory.
Or maybe we'll have a bunch of threads in our program and be creating a data race.
So some sort of contention in our program over a resource.


seg faults
where we access illegal pieces of memory and our
program crashes and how to detect those.

performance related bugs
And there could even be performance related bugs.
So maybe your software is just not running fast enough, and you want to try to figure out how can we make this faster.

Those would be all types of bugs that we might want to analyze.
